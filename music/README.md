# Music
This area is about the music and sounds of the ZX Spectrum.

Some great music has been written for the ZX Spectrum with both the beeper and the AY-3-8912 sound chip.  I have an interest in disassembing the music routines of some of the games as well as extracting the music data and converting it to a readable music score - from which a MIDI file and sound wave can be created.

## Gyroscope
I worked on ripping the 2-channel beeper theme tune music from Gyroscope in March 2021.  You will find a tutorial on how I went about doing this as well as the final scores. My favourite tune is the 2nd theme tune from Gyroscope.  There is also a 4th tune that I've still yet to extract which is played when you complete all the levels.

## Auf Wiedersehen Monty
The 128K music from Auf Wiedersehen Monty is still a favourite of mine.  The music player updates the AY chip 25 times a second and includes a vibrato effect on the melody and the tune itself is a good few minutes long.  I want to come back to this game and rip the music player and tune data.

## Ultimate Play The Game
These games had relatively simple single channel beeper music but nice melodies.  My plan is to extract and convert these to music scores.
